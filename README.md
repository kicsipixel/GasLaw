# GasLaw

### masOS project about Ideal Gas Law for [SwiftUIJam](https://www.swiftuijam.com)

This SwiftUI macOS app models the [Ideal Gas Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law) in a engine cylinder.

Our starting point:

- Atmospheric pressure, 101.325 kPa
- Volume of a cylinder, 400 cm3
- Room temperature, 20ÂºC

These values are added in `Constants/Units.swift`

The gauges drawings were made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com), imported into [PaintCode](https://www.paintcodeapp.com) as .svg. The drawing codes can be found in `Views/Gauges.swift`.

To show the drawing code `NSRepresentableView` is used.

These two Stackoverflow articles helped me:
